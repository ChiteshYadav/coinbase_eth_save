   - Install XAMPP with PHP 8.1 or higher
   - Make sure to include Apache, MySQL, and PHP during installation

2. **Composer Installation**
   - Download Composer from [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
   - Run the Composer installer
   - Make sure to select the PHP from your XAMPP installation during setup

3. **Git Installation**

   - Install Git with default settings

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coinbase_eth_saver.git
   cd coinbase_eth_saver
   ```

2. **Configure XAMPP**
   - Open XAMPP Control Panel
   - Start Apache and MySQL services
   - Click on "Config" button for Apache and select "httpd.conf"
   - Find the `DocumentRoot` and `Directory` settings and update them to point to your project's public folder:
     ```apache
     DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/coinbase_eth_saver/public"
     <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/coinbase_eth_saver/public">
     ```

3. **Database Setup**
   - Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
   - Create a new database named `coinbase_eth_saver`
   - Import the `database/coinbase_eth_saver.sql` file

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update the following settings in `.env`:
     ```
     CI_ENVIRONMENT = development
     database.default.hostname = localhost
     database.default.database = coinbase_eth_saver
     database.default.username = root
     database.default.password = 
     ```

5. **Composer Dependencies**
   - Open Command Prompt in your project directory
   - Run the following commands:
     ```bash
     composer install
     ```

## Fixing Composer Name Error

If you encounter a name error in `composer.json`, follow these steps:

1. **Open composer.json**
   - Make sure the name follows the format: `vendor/package-name`
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
         "name": "yourusername/coinbase-eth-saver",
         "description": "Coinbase ETH Saver Application",
         ...
     }
     ```

2. **Common Windows-specific Issues**
   - If you get permission errors, run Command Prompt as Administrator
   - If you get path-related errors, use forward slashes (/) instead of backslashes (\) in paths
   - Make sure PHP is in your system's PATH environment variable

3. **Verify PHP Version**
   ```bash
   php -v
   ```
   - Should show PHP 8.1 or higher

## Running the Application

1. **Start Services**
   - Open XAMPP Control Panel
   - Start Apache and MySQL services

2. **Access the Application**
   - Open your browser
   - Navigate to `http://localhost/coinbase_eth_saver/public`

## Troubleshooting

1. **Permission Issues**
   - Right-click on the project folder
   - Properties â†’ Security
   - Make sure the XAMPP user has read/write permissions

2. **Apache Configuration**
   - If you get a 404 error, check your Apache configuration
   - Make sure mod_rewrite is enabled in XAMPP

3. **Database Connection**
   - Verify MySQL is running
   - Check database credentials in `.env`
   - Make sure the database exists

4. **Composer Issues**
   - Clear Composer cache:
     ```bash
     composer clear-cache
     ```
   - Update Composer:
     ```bash
     composer self-update
     ```

## Additional Notes

- Always use forward slashes (/) in file paths, even on Windows
- Keep XAMPP's PHP version updated
- Make sure to run Composer commands from the project root directory
- If you get SSL certificate errors, you might need to configure Composer to use the correct certificates
